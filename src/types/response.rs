    ///    2) as a panic shutdown announcement.  The server closes the
    ///       connection immediately.

    ///    3) as an announcement of an inactivity autologout.  The server
    ///       closes the connection immediately.

    ///       indicating that the server is not willing to accept a
    ///       connection from this client.  The server closes the
    ///       connection immediately.
    ///
    /// The difference between a BYE that occurs as part of a normal

    /// a failure (the other three cases) is that the connection closes
    /// immediately in the failure case.  In all cases the client SHOULD

    ///   the highest n messages in the mailbox (where n is the
    ///   value reported by the RECENT response).  Examples of
    ///   situations in which this is not the case are: multiple
    ///   clients having the same mailbox open (the first session
    ///   to be notified will see it as recent, others will
    ///   probably see it as non-recent), and when the mailbox is
    ///   re-ordered by a non-IMAP agent.

    // ## 7.4. Server Responses - Message Status
    //
    // These responses are always untagged.  This is how message data are
    // transmitted from the server to the client, often as a result of a
    // command with the same name.  Immediately following the "*" token is a
    // number that represents a message sequence number.
    /// ### 7.4.1. EXPUNGE Response
    ///
    /// The EXPUNGE response reports that the specified message sequence
    /// number has been permanently removed from the mailbox.  The message
    /// sequence number for each successive message in the mailbox is
    /// immediately decremented by 1, and this decrement is reflected in
    /// message sequence numbers in subsequent responses (including other
    /// untagged EXPUNGE responses).
    ///
    /// The EXPUNGE response also decrements the number of messages in the
    /// mailbox; it is not necessary to send an EXISTS response with the
    /// new value.
    ///
    /// As a result of the immediate decrement rule, message sequence
    /// numbers that appear in a set of successive EXPUNGE responses
    /// depend upon whether the messages are removed starting from lower
    /// numbers to higher numbers, or from higher numbers to lower
    /// numbers.  For example, if the last 5 messages in a 9-message
    /// mailbox are expunged, a "lower to higher" server will send five
    /// untagged EXPUNGE responses for message sequence number 5, whereas
    /// a "higher to lower server" will send successive untagged EXPUNGE
    /// responses for message sequence numbers 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5.
    ///
    /// An EXPUNGE response MUST NOT be sent when no command is in
    /// progress, nor while responding to a FETCH, STORE, or SEARCH
    /// command.  This rule is necessary to prevent a loss of
    /// synchronization of message sequence numbers between client and
    /// server.  A command is not "in progress" until the complete command
    /// has been received; in particular, a command is not "in progress"
    /// during the negotiation of command continuation.
    ///
    ///   Note: UID FETCH, UID STORE, and UID SEARCH are different
    ///   commands from FETCH, STORE, and SEARCH.  An EXPUNGE
    ///   response MAY be sent during a UID command.
